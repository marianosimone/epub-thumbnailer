# What?
epub-thumbnailer is a simple script that tries to find a cover into an epub file and creates a thumbnail for it.

# Why?
Because I want my file manager (Nautilus, Thunar, Caja, et al.) to display nice thumnails for my epub ebooks, as it does for pdf files or images, to go from this:

to this:

# How to install?

Run the installer!

    sudo python install.py install

Basically, it moves the thumbnailer script to /usr/bin and installs the necessary hooks:

- In gnome2, using a gconf schema (check src/epub-thumbnailer.schemas)
- In gnome3, using a thumbnailer entry (check src/epub.thumbnailer)

After installation, you might need to restart your file manager and remove cached thumbnails (~/.cache/thumbnails)

# Stand-alone

This will look into the **epub_file** to find its cover, and will save a **size** px png file as **output_file**

    epub-thumbnailer <epub_file> <output_file> <size>
